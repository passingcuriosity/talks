This repository contains some notes I've written on various topics before
giving or after seeing talks on topics that interest me.

They are variously incomplete, incorrect, or otherwise unsuitable for others,
but they are here.

To produce PDFs: install `lhs2TeX` and a sufficiently comprehensive modern
TeX distribution and run `make`.

Talks
-----

- [*So you think you can map*](structured-graphs/) trys to explain the key
  details of the *Functional programming with structured graphs* paper from
  the perspective of "gee, that looks a lot like the `Free f a` datatype".

- [*Free things*](free-things/) trys to explain what "free" means and looks a
  few examples.

- [An untitled recursion schemes talk](recursion-schemes/) trys to explain
  enough about recursion schemes to explain what a histozygomorphic prepromorphism
  does.

- [*Berkeley Packet Filters*](bpf/) introduces the BPF facility and some of the
  things it's used for in the Linux kernel.

Notes
-----

- [*Some notes on cubical type theory*](cubical-types/) is some notes I took
  from a talk about cubical type theory given by Ben Lippmeier in 2017. One day
  I will go back and finish them off.

- [*A computational sketch of homology*](homology/) contains some Literate
  Haskell notes I'm putting together about computational homology.

- [*Some notes on queueing theory*](queueing/) contains notes on simple analyses
  of queueing systems.
