Talks
=====

This repository contains text and code written for various talks I've
given. Pretty much just "tech talks" from work.

- `structured-graphs` trys to explain the key details of the *Functional
  programming with structured graphs* paper from the perspective of "gee,
  that looks a lot like the `Free f a` datatype".

- `free-things` trys to explain what "free" means and looks a few examples.

- `recursion-schemes` trys to explain enough about recursion schemes to tell
  what a histozygomorphic prepromorphism does.

- `cubical-types` is some notes I took from a talk about cubical type theory
  given by Ben Lippmeier.
